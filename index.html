Truman, a <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a> and vice president under <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, had ascended to the presidency upon Roosevelt's death in 1945. He announced his candidacy for election on March<span class="nowrap"> </span>8, 1948. Unchallenged by any major nominee in the <a href="/wiki/1948_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries" title="1948 Democratic Party presidential primaries">Democratic primaries</a>, he won almost all of them easily; however, many Democrats like <a href="/wiki/James_Roosevelt" title="James Roosevelt">James Roosevelt</a> opposed his candidacy and urged former <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_Staff_of_the_United_States_Army" title="Chief of Staff of the United States Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D.

            <p>The <a href="/wiki/Progressive_Party_(United_States,_1948)" title="Progressive Party (United States, 1948)">Progressive Party</a> nominated <a href="/wiki/Henry_A._Wallace" title="Henry A.

With a split of the Democratic Party, most polls and political writers predicted victory for Dewey and gave Truman little chance. 
</p>
            <p>During the campaign, Truman mostly focused on blaming the Republican-controlled Congress for not passing his legislation, calling it a "do-nothing Congress." In early September 1948, Truman conducted various <a href="/wiki/Whistle-stop_train_tour" title="Whistle-stop train tour">whistle-stop tours</a> across the nation, covering over 21,928 miles (35,290 km) on the <i><a href="/wiki/Ferdinand_Magellan_(railcar)" title="Ferdinand Magellan (railcar)">Ferdinand Magellan railcar</a></i>. Of all of the speeches which he gave during his whistle-stop tour, only about 70 were broadcast on the radio even locally, and only 20 of them were heard nationally. During the final days of the campaign, the Truman campaign released a film titled <i>The Truman Story</i> showing newsreel footage of the whistle-stop tour. Although he received some endorsements, including that of <a href="/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> president <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, most broadcasting companies were sure of Dewey's victory. Ultimately, Truman won with 303 <a href="/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College" title="United States Electoral College">electoral votes</a> to Dewey's 189 and Thurmond's 39. Before the results were released, an early edition of the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune"><i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i></a> wrongly anticipated the result with the headline "<a href="/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman" title="Dewey Defeats Truman">Dewey Defeats Truman</a>". <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine later described an image of Truman holding the newspaper as the "greatest photograph ever made of a politician celebrating victory."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBaime2020342_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaime2020342-2">[2]</a></sup> Truman and Barkley were inaugurated on January 20, 1949. Truman's 1948 campaign and the election are most remembered for the failure of polls and Truman's <a href="/wiki/Upset_(competition)" title="Upset (competition)">upset victory</a>.
