            <p><b>Suzanne Rachel Flore Lenglen</b> (<small>French pronunciation: ​</small><span class="IPA" lang="fr-Latn-fonipa" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><a href="/wiki/Help:IPA/French" title="Help:IPA/French">[syzan lɑ̃ɡlɛn]</a></span>;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEngelmann1988254_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngelmann1988254-8">[6]</a></sup> 24 May 1899 – 4 July 1938) was a French <a href="/wiki/Tennis" title="Tennis">tennis</a> player. She was the inaugural <a href="/wiki/World_number_1_ranked_female_tennis_players" title="World number 1 ranked female tennis players">world No.<span class="nowrap"> </span>1</a> from 1921 to 1926, winning 8 <a href="/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)" title="Grand Slam (tennis)">Grand Slam</a> titles in singles and 21 in total. She was also a four-time <a href="/wiki/World_Hard_Court_Championships" title="World Hard Court Championships">World Hard Court Champion</a> in singles, and ten times in total.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[c]</a></sup> Lenglen won six <a href="/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon" title="The Championships, Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> singles titles, including five in a row from 1919 to 1923, and was the champion in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at the first two open <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/French_Open_(tennis)" title="French Open (tennis)">French Championships</a> in 1925 and 1926. In doubles, she was undefeated with her usual partner <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Ryan" title="Elizabeth Ryan">Elizabeth Ryan</a>, highlighted by another six titles at Wimbledon. Lenglen was the first leading amateur to turn professional, and was ranked as the greatest women's tennis player from the amateur era in the <i><a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_of_All_Time" title="100 Greatest of All Time">100 Greatest of All Time</a></i> series.
</p>
            <p>Coached by her father Charles throughout her career, Lenglen began playing tennis at age 11, becoming the youngest major champion in history with her <a href="/wiki/1914_World_Hard_Court_Championships" title="1914 World Hard Court Championships">1914 World Hard Court Championship</a> title at age 15. This success, along with her balletic playing style and brash personality, helped make Lenglen a national heroine in a country coping with the aftermath of World War<span class="nowrap"> </span>I. After the war delayed her career four years, Lenglen was largely unchallenged. She won her Wimbledon debut in 1919 in the <a href="/wiki/1919_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_singles_final" title="1919 Wimbledon Championships – Women's singles final">second-longest final</a> in history, the only one of her major singles finals she did not win by a lopsided scoreline. Her <a href="/wiki/Lenglen%E2%80%93Mallory_match_at_the_1921_U.S._National_Championships" title="Lenglen–Mallory match at the 1921 U.S. National Championships">only post-war loss</a> came in a retirement against <a href="/wiki/Molla_Mallory" title="Molla Mallory">Molla Mallory</a>, her only amateur match in the United States. Afterwards, she began a 179-match win streak, during which she defeated <a href="/wiki/Helen_Wills" title="Helen Wills">Helen Wills</a> in the high-profile <a href="/wiki/Match_of_the_Century_(tennis)" title="Match of the Century (tennis)">Match of the Century</a> in 1926. Following a <a href="/wiki/Lenglen%E2%80%93Dewhurst_match_at_the_1926_Wimbledon_Championships" title="Lenglen–Dewhurst match at the 1926 Wimbledon Championships">misunderstanding at Wimbledon</a> later that year, Lenglen abruptly retired from amateur tennis, signing to headline a professional tour in the United States beginning that same year.
</p>
            <p>Referred to by the French press as <i>La Divine</i> (The Goddess), Lenglen revolutionised the sport by integrating the aggressive style of men's tennis into the women's game and breaking the convention of women competing in clothing unsuitable for tennis. She incorporated fashion into her matches, highlighted by her signature bandeau headwear. Lenglen is recognised as the first female athlete to become a global sport celebrity and her popularity led Wimbledon to move to its larger modern-day venue. Her professional tours laid the foundation for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tennis_Pro_Tours" title="Tennis Pro Tours">series of men's professional tours</a> that continued until the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Open_Era_(tennis)" title="Open Era (tennis)">Open Era</a>, and led to the first <a href="/wiki/Major_professional_tennis_tournaments_before_the_Open_Era" title="Major professional tennis tournaments before the Open Era">major men's professional tournament</a> the following year. Lenglen was inducted into the <a href="/wiki/International_Tennis_Hall_of_Fame" title="International Tennis Hall of Fame">International Tennis Hall of Fame</a> in 1978, and the second show court at the <a href="/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros" title="Stade Roland Garros">site of the French Open</a> is named in her honour.
