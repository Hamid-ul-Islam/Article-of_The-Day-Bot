            <p><b>Tropical Storm Carrie</b> was a strong tropical storm that affected the East Coast of the United States in early September 1972. The third <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="/wiki/1972_Atlantic_hurricane_season" title="1972 Atlantic hurricane season">1972 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Carrie formed on August 29 from a complex sequence of meteorological events starting with the emergence of a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_wave" title="Tropical wave">tropical wave</a> into the Atlantic in the middle of August. Tracking generally northward throughout its life, Carrie reached an initial peak intensity as a moderate tropical storm before nearly weakening back into tropical depression status. The storm began to intensify in a <a href="/wiki/Baroclinity" title="Baroclinity">baroclinic environment</a> after turning toward the northwest, its winds of 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) as it was transitioning into an <a href="/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone" title="Extratropical cyclone">extratropical system</a> eclipsed the cyclone's previous maximum strength. The extratropical remnants of Carrie skirted eastern <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> before making the landfall in <a href="/wiki/Maine" title="Maine">Maine</a> on September 4 and dissipating over the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gulf_of_Saint_Lawrence" title="Gulf of Saint Lawrence">Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a> during the next two days.
</p>
            <p>Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England, limited to increased swells, gusty winds, and light rainfall. The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England, where wind gusts reached 84 mph (135 km/h) and rainfall exceeded 1 ft (300 mm). Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast. Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service. Overall damage was generally light, with total monetary losses valued at $1,780,000, and four deaths are blamed on the storm.

            <p>The origins of Tropical Storm Carrie are traced back to a tropical wave—an elongated area of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Low_pressure_area" title="Low pressure area">low atmospheric air pressure</a>—that emerged from the western coast of Africa on August 15, 1972. A relatively strong weather system, the wave progressed westward, but by the time it had reached the <a href="/wiki/Leeward_Islands" title="Leeward Islands">Leeward Islands</a> ten days later, it had degenerated substantially. The influence of a nearby <a href="/wiki/Cold-core_low" title="Cold-core low">upper-level</a> low pressure system caused the disturbance to further deteriorate, and the resultant remnant circulation drifted toward the northwest; by August 28, it was situated at a position just offshore southeastern <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>. The low pressure system maintained a <a href="/wiki/Cold-core_low" title="Cold-core low">cold core</a> and had not yet established itself at the surface. On August 29, the low began moving northward in response to an approaching <a href="/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)" title="Trough (meteorology)">trough</a>. For the first time, a low-level circulation center had been identified in association with the system,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MWR_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-MWR-1">[1]</a></sup> and the storm became a tropical depression at 1200 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UTC" title="UTC">UTC</a> while located east of the central Florida peninsula.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-HURDAT_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-HURDAT-2">[2]</a></sup> The depression tracked steadily northeastward as it gradually intensified.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MWR_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-MWR-1">[1]</a></sup>

            <p>On August 31, <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> aircraft flying into the cyclone reported <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maximum_sustained_winds" title="Maximum sustained winds">maximum sustained winds</a> of up to around 55 mph (89 km/h).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MWR_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-MWR-1">[1]</a></sup> Post-storm reanalysis estimated the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm at around 0000 UTC on August 31.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-HURDAT_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-HURDAT-2">[2]</a></sup> Operationally, however, it was not recognized as such until 2200 UTC that day, when it was assigned the name Carrie. At the time, the system was located approximately 350 miles (560 km) east of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cape_Hatteras,_North_Carolina" title="Cape Hatteras, North Carolina">Cape Hatteras, North Carolina</a>. A small storm, Carrie slowed drastically in forward movement as it curved northward.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> By the time it was identified as a tropical storm in real-time, Carrie had already reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 km/h) and a minimum <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure" title="Atmospheric pressure">central pressure</a> of 1,002 <a href="/wiki/Bar_(unit)" title="Bar (unit)">millibars</a> (29.6 <a href="/wiki/Inch_of_mercury" title="Inch of mercury">inHg</a>), and strong <a href="/wiki/Wind_shear" title="Wind shear">wind shear</a> inhibited immediate strengthening as it continue to slow to a drift. On September 1, Carrie began to weaken, and by early on September 2, it had dwindled to a minimal tropical storm with winds of only 40 mph (64 km/h).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MWR_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-MWR-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-HURDAT_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-HURDAT-2">[2]</a></sup> Satellite imagery indicated that the storm's center of circulation had become distorted with little or no associated <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Convection_(meteorology)" title="Convection (meteorology)">convection</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> At its weakest, the storm's highest winds were found far from the center, likely generated more by the increasing <a href="/wiki/Pressure_gradient" title="Pressure gradient">pressure gradient</a> in relation to an <a href="/wiki/Anticyclone" title="Anticyclone">anticyclone</a> to the north than by the low pressure center itself.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-MWR_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-MWR-1">[1]</a></sup>
