            <p>Nintendo's vision for the <i>Paper Mario</i> series following <i><a href="/wiki/Paper_Mario:_Sticker_Star" title="Paper Mario: Sticker Star">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a></i> was to differentiate it from their other RPG <i>Mario</i> series, <i><a href="/wiki/Mario_%26_Luigi" title="Mario &amp; Luigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></i>. The development team focused on puzzle-solving and comedic elements, and to make each game different from one another, emphasize an overarching <a href="/wiki/Gimmick" title="Gimmick">gimmick</a>. The paint theme was conceived by Atsushi Isano, the director for Intelligent Systems, and developed to take advantage of the <a href="/wiki/Wii_U_GamePad" title="Wii U GamePad">Wii U GamePad</a>. A card-based battle system was implemented to use the GamePad touchscreen to sort, paint, and flick cards. The artists focused on making the paper textures appear as realistic as possible.

            <p><i>Color Splash</i> was announced via a <a href="/wiki/Nintendo_Direct" title="Nintendo Direct">Nintendo Direct</a> in March 2016 and released worldwide in October 2016. Upon its announcement, it drew controversy for continuing an action-adventure and gimmick-oriented format introduced in <i>Sticker Star</i>. On release, however, it received praise for its graphics, soundtrack, and improved dialogue. Conversely, the combat system and its lack of RPG elements were criticized, much like its predecessor, although some critics cited improvements to its structure.
