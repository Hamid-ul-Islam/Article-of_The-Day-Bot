            <p><b>Khalid ibn al-Walid ibn al-Mughira al-Makhzumi</b> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <span dir="rtl" lang="ar">خالد بن الوليد بن المغيرة المخزومي</span>, <small><a href="/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic" title="Romanization of Arabic">romanized</a>: </small><span title="Arabic-language romanization"><i lang="ar-Latn">Khālid ibn al-Walīd ibn al-Mughīra al-Makhzūmī</i></span>; died 642) was an Arab Muslim commander in the service of the Islamic prophet <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Rashidun" title="Rashidun">Rashidun</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caliph" title="Caliph">caliphs</a> <a href="/wiki/Abu_Bakr" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> (<span style="white-space:nowrap;"><abbr title="reigned">r.</abbr> 632–634</span>) and <a href="/wiki/Umar" title="Umar">Umar</a> (<span style="white-space:nowrap;"><abbr title="reigned">r.</abbr> 634–644</span>). He played the leading military role in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ridda_wars" title="Ridda wars">Ridda wars</a> against rebel tribes in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arabia" title="Arabia">Arabia</a> in 632–633, the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Persia#First_invasion_of_Mesopotamia_(633)" title="Muslim conquest of Persia">initial campaigns in Sasanian Iraq</a> in 633–634 and the <a href="/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_the_Levant" title="Muslim conquest of the Levant">conquest of Byzantine Syria</a> in 634–638.
</p>
            <p>A horseman of the <a href="/wiki/Quraysh" title="Quraysh">Quraysh</a> tribe's aristocratic clan, the <a href="/wiki/Banu_Makhzum" title="Banu Makhzum">Makhzum</a>, which ardently opposed Muhammad, Khalid played the instrumental role in defeating the Muslims at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Uhud" title="Battle of Uhud">Battle of Uhud</a> in 625. Following his conversion to Islam in 627 or 629, he was made a commander by Muhammad, who bestowed on him the title <span title="Arabic-language romanization"><i lang="ar-Latn">Sayf Allah</i></span> ('the Sword of God'). Khalid coordinated the safe withdrawal of Muslim troops during the abortive <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Mu%27tah" title="Battle of Mu'tah">expedition to Mu'ta</a> against the Arab allies of the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantines</a> in 629 and led the <a href="/wiki/Bedouin" title="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> contingents of the Muslim army during the <a href="/wiki/Conquest_of_Mecca" title="Conquest of Mecca">capture of Mecca</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hunayn" title="Battle of Hunayn">Battle of Hunayn</a> in <abbr title="circa">c.</abbr><span style="white-space:nowrap;"> 630</span>. After Muhammad's death, Khalid was appointed to suppress or subjugate Arab tribes in <a href="/wiki/Najd" title="Najd">Najd</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Al-Yamama" title="Al-Yamama">Yamama</a> (both regions in central Arabia) opposed to the <a href="/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate" title="Rashidun Caliphate">nascent Muslim state</a>, defeating the rebel leaders <a href="/wiki/Tulayha" title="Tulayha">Tulayha</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Buzakha" title="Battle of Buzakha">Battle of Buzakha</a> in 632 and <a href="/wiki/Musaylima" title="Musaylima">Musaylima</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Yamama" title="Battle of Yamama">Battle of Aqraba</a> in 633.
</p>
            <p>Khalid subsequently moved against the largely <a href="/wiki/Arab_Christians" title="Arab Christians">Christian Arab</a> tribes and the <a href="/wiki/Sasanian_Empire" title="Sasanian Empire">Sasanian Persian</a> garrisons of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Euphrates_River" title="Euphrates River">Euphrates</a> valley in Iraq. He was reassigned by Abu Bakr to command the Muslim armies in Syria and he led his men there on an unconventional march across a long, waterless stretch of the <a href="/wiki/Syrian_Desert" title="Syrian Desert">Syrian Desert</a>, boosting his reputation as a military strategist. As a result of decisive victories against the Byzantines at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Ajnadayn" title="Battle of Ajnadayn">Ajnadayn</a> (634), <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fahl" title="Battle of Fahl">Fahl</a> (634 or 635), <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Damascus_(634)" title="Siege of Damascus (634)">Damascus</a> (634–635) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Battle_of_Yarmouk" title="Battle of Yarmouk">Yarmouk</a> (636), the Muslims under Khalid conquered most of Syria. He was afterward demoted from the high command by Umar. Khalid continued service as the key lieutenant of his successor <a href="/wiki/Abu_Ubayda_ibn_al-Jarrah" title="Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah">Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Emesa_(638)" title="Siege of Emesa (638)">sieges of Homs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Aleppo_(637)" title="Siege of Aleppo (637)">Aleppo</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hazir" title="Battle of Hazir">Battle of Qinnasrin</a>, all in 637–638, which collectively precipitated the retreat from Syria of imperial Byzantine troops under Emperor <a href="/wiki/Heraclius" title="Heraclius">Heraclius</a>. Umar dismissed Khalid from his governorship of <a href="/wiki/Jund_Qinnasrin" title="Jund Qinnasrin">Qinnasrin</a> afterward and he died in <a href="/wiki/Medina" title="Medina">Medina</a> or <a href="/wiki/Homs" title="Homs">Homs</a> in 642.

            <p>Khalid is generally considered by historians to be one of early Islam's most seasoned and accomplished generals and he is commemorated throughout the <a href="/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world">Arab world</a>. The Islamic tradition credits Khalid for his battlefield tactics and effective leadership of the <a href="/wiki/Early_Muslim_conquests" title="Early Muslim conquests">early Muslim conquests</a>, but accuses him of illicitly executing Arab tribesmen who had accepted Islam, namely members of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Banu_Jadhima" title="Banu Jadhima">Banu Jadhima</a> during the lifetime of Muhammad and <a href="/wiki/Malik_ibn_Nuwayra" title="Malik ibn Nuwayra">Malik ibn Nuwayra</a> during the Ridda wars, and moral and fiscal misconduct in Syria. His military fame disturbed some of the pious early Muslims, including Umar, who feared it could develop into a <a href="/wiki/Cult_of_personality" title="Cult of personality">personality cult</a>.
