            <p>The <b>Jubilee coinage</b> or <b>Jubilee head coinage</b> are British coins with an <a href="/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse" title="Obverse and reverse">obverse</a> featuring a depiction of <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Edgar_Boehm" title="Joseph Edgar Boehm">Joseph Edgar Boehm</a>. The design was placed on the silver and gold circulating coinage beginning in 1887, and on the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maundy_coinage" title="Maundy coinage">Maundy coinage</a> beginning in 1888. The depiction of Victoria wearing a crown that was seen as too small was widely mocked, and was replaced in 1893. The series saw the entire issuance of the <a href="/wiki/Double_florin" title="Double florin">double florin</a> (1887–1890) and, in 1888, the last issue for circulation of the groat, or <a href="/wiki/Fourpence_(British_coin)" title="Fourpence (British coin)">fourpence piece</a>, although it was intended for use in <a href="/wiki/British_Guiana" title="British Guiana">British Guiana</a>. No bronze coins (the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_British_penny_(1714%E2%80%931901)" title="History of the British penny (1714–1901)">penny</a> and its fractions) were struck with the Jubilee design.
</p>
            <p>In 1879, Boehm was selected to create a new depiction of Victoria that could be adapted for the coinage – even though the queen marked her 60th birthday that year, some British coins still showed her as she appeared forty years previously. Boehm gave only intermittent attention to the project, and it took years before it came to fruition. The queen finally gave approval in early 1887, and the new coinage was prepared. Some of the <a href="/wiki/Obverse_and_reverse" title="Obverse and reverse">reverse</a> designs for the coinage were changed at the same time, depicting heraldic imagery and engraved by <a href="/wiki/Leonard_Charles_Wyon" title="Leonard Charles Wyon">Leonard Charles Wyon</a>.
</p>
            <p>When the new coins were released in June 1887, they proved a popular souvenir of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria%27s_Golden_Jubilee" title="Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee">Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee</a>. They were criticised not only for the diminutive crown, but because the new reverse designs did not state the value of the coin. The <a href="/wiki/Sixpence_(British_coin)" title="Sixpence (British coin)">sixpence</a> was gilded by fraudsters to pass as a <a href="/wiki/Half_sovereign" title="Half sovereign">half sovereign</a>, and it was quickly withdrawn by the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Mint" title="Royal Mint">Royal Mint</a>, which resumed its old reverse design (stating its value), slightly modified. Royal Mint authorities began to consider replacing the Jubilee issue within a year of its release, and this may have been hastened by Boehm's death in 1890. A committee was created to consider replacements, and the <a href="/wiki/Old_Head_coinage" title="Old Head coinage">Old Head coinage</a>, with an obverse created by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Brock" title="Thomas Brock">Thomas Brock</a>, began to be struck in 1893.
</p>
            <p>By the late 1870s, most denominations of British coins carried versions of the obverse design featuring <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> created by <a href="/wiki/William_Wyon" title="William Wyon">William Wyon</a> and first introduced in 1838, the year after she acceded to the throne. The queen, approaching her 60th birthday, no longer resembled her numismatic depiction; and in February 1879, the private secretary to the queen, Sir <a href="/wiki/Henry_Ponsonby" title="Henry Ponsonby">Henry Ponsonby</a>, informed the Deputy Master of the Royal Mint,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[a]</a></sup> Charles Fremantle, that <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Edgar_Boehm" title="Joseph Edgar Boehm">Joseph Edgar Boehm</a> had been engaged to produce a medallic likeness of the queen that could be adapted for coinage purposes. Born in Austria, Boehm had trained as a medallist and had undertaken several sculptural commissions for the royal family.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDyer_&amp;_Stocker274_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDyer_&amp;_Stocker274-2">[1]</a></sup>
