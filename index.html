            <p>The <b>Battle of Halidon Hill</b> took place on 19 July 1333 when a Scottish army under <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Douglas_(died_1333)" title="Archibald Douglas (died 1333)">Sir Archibald Douglas</a> attacked an English army commanded by King <a href="/wiki/Edward_III_of_England" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a> (<span style="white-space:nowrap;"><abbr title="reigned">r.</abbr> 1327–1377</span>) and was heavily defeated. The year before, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Balliol" title="Edward Balliol">Edward Balliol</a> had seized the Scottish Crown from five-year-old <a href="/wiki/David_II_of_Scotland" title="David II of Scotland">David II</a> (<span style="white-space:nowrap;"><abbr title="reigned">r.</abbr> 1329–1371</span>), surreptitiously supported by Edward III. This marked the start of the <a href="/wiki/Second_War_of_Scottish_Independence" title="Second War of Scottish Independence">Second War of Scottish Independence</a>. Balliol was shortly expelled from Scotland by a popular uprising, which Edward III used as a <i><a href="/wiki/Casus_belli" title="Casus belli">casus belli</a></i>, invading Scotland in 1333. The immediate target was the strategically important border town of <a href="/wiki/Berwick-upon-Tweed" title="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, which the English besieged in March.
</p>
            <p>A large Scottish army advanced to relieve the town. They attempted and failed to draw the English away from Berwick. By mid-July, knowing Berwick was on the verge of surrender and aware they were much stronger than the English, the Scots attacked. They unsuccessfully manoeuvred for position and then launched an assault on the English, who had taken up a favourable defensive position. <a href="/wiki/English_longbow" title="English longbow">English longbowmen</a> caused heavy Scottish casualties during their approach and when the Scots came into contact with the English <a href="/wiki/Infantry" title="Infantry">infantry</a> the fight was short. The Scottish formations collapsed and the Scots fled in disorder. The English <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Men-at-arms" title="Men-at-arms">men-at-arms</a> mounted and pursued the Scots for eight miles causing further heavy casualties. The Scottish commander and many of the Scots' senior nobility were killed during the battle.
</p>
            <p>Berwick <a href="/wiki/Capitulation_(surrender)" title="Capitulation (surrender)">surrendered on terms</a> the next day. Balliol was reinstalled as king of Scotland after ceding much of his territory to Edward III and agreeing to do <a href="/wiki/Homage_(feudal)" title="Homage (feudal)">homage</a> for the balance. Balliol's opponents would not admit defeat and he was deposed again in 1334, restored in 1335 and deposed once again in 1336. In 1337 the Hundred Years' War broke out between France and England which allowed David II to consolidate his position in Scotland. In 1346 the Scots were decisively beaten at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Neville%27s_Cross" title="Battle of Neville's Cross">Battle of Neville's Cross</a> with heavy loss and David was captured. It was eleven years before terms were agreed for David's release. This included an <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Berwick_(1357)" title="Treaty of Berwick (1357)">Anglo-Scottish truce</a>, which lasted for four decades and marked the end of the Second War of Scottish Independence.
