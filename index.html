            <p>The <b>Battle of the Tenaru</b>, sometimes called the <b>Battle of the Ilu River</b> or the <b>Battle of Alligator Creek</b>, was a land battle between the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army" title="Imperial Japanese Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> and <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> ground forces that took place on 21 August 1942, on the island of <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal" title="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_War" title="Pacific War">Pacific campaign</a> of World War II. The battle was the first major Japanese land offensive during the <a href="/wiki/Guadalcanal_campaign" title="Guadalcanal campaign">Guadalcanal campaign</a>.
</p>
            <p>In the battle, <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">U.S. Marines</a>, under the overall command of U.S. <a href="/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)" title="Major general (United States)">Major General</a> <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Vandegrift" title="Alexander Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, repulsed an assault by the "First Element" of the "Ichiki" Regiment, under the command of Japanese Colonel <a href="/wiki/Kiyonao_Ichiki" title="Kiyonao Ichiki">Kiyonao Ichiki</a>. The Marines were defending the Lunga perimeter, which guarded <a href="/wiki/Henderson_Field_(Guadalcanal)" title="Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)">Henderson Field</a>, which had been captured by the Allies in landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August. Ichiki's unit was sent to Guadalcanal in response to the Allied landings with the mission of recapturing the airfield and driving the Allied forces off the island.
</p>
            <p>Underestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at the time numbered about 11,000 personnel, Ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime <a href="/wiki/Frontal_assault" title="Frontal assault">frontal assault</a> on Marine positions at Alligator Creek on the east side of the Lunga perimeter. <a href="/wiki/Jacob_C._Vouza" title="Jacob C. Vouza">Jacob Vouza</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Coastwatchers" title="Coastwatchers">Coastwatcher scout</a>, warned the Americans of the impending attack minutes before Ichiki's assault. The Japanese were defeated with heavy losses. The Marines counterattacked Ichiki's surviving troops after daybreak, killing many more. About 800 of the original 917 of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element died.
