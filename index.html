            <p><b>Apollo 4</b> (November 9, 1967), also known as <b>SA-501</b>, was the first test of the <a href="/wiki/Saturn_V" title="Saturn V">Saturn V</a> launch vehicle, the rocket that eventually took astronauts to the <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">Moon</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Space_vehicle" title="Space vehicle">space vehicle</a> was assembled in the <a href="/wiki/Vehicle_Assembly_Building" title="Vehicle Assembly Building">Vehicle Assembly Building</a>, and was the first to be launched from <a href="/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center" title="Kennedy Space Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> (KSC) in Florida, ascending from <a href="/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center_Launch_Complex_39" title="Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39">Launch Complex 39</a>, where facilities built specially for the Saturn<span class="nowrap"> </span>V had been constructed.
</p>
            <p>Apollo 4 was an "all-up" test, meaning all rocket stages and spacecraft were fully functional on the initial flight, a first for <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>. It was the first time the <a href="/wiki/S-IC" title="S-IC">S-IC</a> first stage and <a href="/wiki/S-II" title="S-II">S-II</a> second stage flew. It also demonstrated the <a href="/wiki/S-IVB" title="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage's first in-flight restart. The mission used a Block<span class="nowrap"> </span>I <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Command_and_service_module" title="Command and service module">command and service module</a> modified to test several key Block<span class="nowrap"> </span>II revisions, including its <a href="/wiki/Heat_shield" title="Heat shield">heat shield</a> at simulated lunar-return velocity and angle.
</p>
            <p>The original launch date was planned for early 1967, but was delayed to November<span class="nowrap"> </span>9, due to a myriad of problems with various elements of the spacecraft, and difficulties during pre-flight testing. The need for additional inspections following the <a href="/wiki/Apollo_1" title="Apollo 1">Apollo 1</a> fire, which killed the first Apollo crew in January 1967, also contributed to delays. These issues delayed the flight through much of 1967.
</p>
            <p>The mission splashed-down in the Pacific Ocean slightly less than nine hours after launch, having achieved its objectives. NASA considered the mission a complete success, proving that the Saturn<span class="nowrap"> </span>V worked, an important step towards achieving the main objective of landing astronauts on the Moon, and bringing them back safely, before the end of the 1960s.
