Leni's adaptation of Willard's play blended expressionism with humor, a style for which Leni was notable and recognized by critics as unique.

The film was one of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a>'s early horror productions and is considered "the cornerstone of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Universal_Monsters" title="Universal Monsters">Universal's school of horror</a>".<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Clarens_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Clarens-1">[1]</a></sup> The play has been filmed five other times, <a href="/wiki/The_Cat_and_the_Canary_(1939_film)" title="The Cat and the Canary (1939 film)">most notably in 1939</a>, starring <a href="/wiki/Bob_Hope" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paulette_Goddard" title="Paulette Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a>.

            <p>In a decaying mansion overlooking the <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River" title="Hudson River">Hudson River</a>, millionaire Cyrus West approaches death. His greedy family descends upon him like "cats around a canary", causing him to become <a href="/wiki/Insanity" title="Insanity">insane</a>. West orders that his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Will_(law)" title="Will (law)">last will and testament</a> remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. As the appointed time arrives, West's lawyer, Roger Crosby (<a href="/wiki/Tully_Marshall" title="Tully Marshall">Tully Marshall</a>), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. The caretaker of the West mansion, Mammy Pleasant (<a href="/wiki/Martha_Mattox" title="Martha Mattox">Martha Mattox</a>), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West, a notion that the astonished Crosby quickly rejects.

            <p>As midnight approaches, West's relatives arrive at the mansion: nephews Harry Blythe (<a href="/wiki/Arthur_Edmund_Carewe" title="Arthur Edmund Carewe">Arthur Edmund Carewe</a>), Charles "Charlie" Wilder (<a href="/wiki/Forrest_Stanley" title="Forrest Stanley">Forrest Stanley</a>), Paul Jones (<a href="/wiki/Creighton_Hale" title="Creighton Hale">Creighton Hale</a>), his sister Susan Sillsby (<a href="/wiki/Flora_Finch" title="Flora Finch">Flora Finch</a>) and her niece Cecily Young (<a href="/wiki/Gertrude_Astor" title="Gertrude Astor">Gertrude Astor</a>), and niece Annabelle West (<a href="/wiki/Laura_La_Plante" title="Laura La Plante">Laura La Plante</a>). Cyrus West's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name "West": Annabelle. The will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, Ira Lazar (<a href="/wiki/Lucien_Littlefield" title="Lucien Littlefield">Lucien Littlefield</a>). If she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. Annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle, "in a cage surrounded by cats."
