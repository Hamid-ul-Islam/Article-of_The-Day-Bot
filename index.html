            <p><span title="Hepburn transliteration"><i lang="ja-Latn"><b>Kaze to Ki no Uta</b></i></span><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<a href="/wiki/Japanese_language" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a>: <span lang="ja">風と木の詩</span>, <abbr title="literal translation">lit.</abbr> "The Poem of Wind and Trees" or "The Song of Wind and Trees")</span> is a Japanese <a href="/wiki/Manga" title="Manga">manga</a> series written and illustrated by <a href="/wiki/Keiko_Takemiya" title="Keiko Takemiya">Keiko Takemiya</a>. It was serialized in the <a href="/wiki/List_of_manga_magazines" title="List of manga magazines">manga magazine</a> <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_Comic" title="Shōjo Comic">Shūkan Shōjo Comic</a></i> from 1976 to 1980, and in the manga magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Petit_Flower" title="Petit Flower">Petit Flower</a></i> from 1981 to 1984. One of the earliest works in the <a href="/wiki/Yaoi" title="Yaoi"><span title="Japanese-language romanization"><i lang="ja-Latn">shōnen-ai</i></span></a> (male–male romance) genre, <i>Kaze to Ki no Uta</i> follows the tragic romance between Gilbert Cocteau and Serge Battour, two students at an all-boys boarding school in late 19th-century France.
</p>
            <p>The series was developed and published amid a significant transitional period for <a href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_manga" title="Shōjo manga"><span title="Japanese-language romanization"><i lang="ja-Latn">shōjo</i></span> manga</a> (manga for girls), as the medium shifted from an audience composed primarily of children to an audience of adolescents and young adults. This shift was characterized by the emergence of more narratively complex stories focused on politics, psychology, and sexuality, and came to be embodied by a new generation of <span title="Japanese-language romanization"><i lang="ja-Latn">shōjo</i></span> manga artists collectively referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Year_24_Group" title="Year 24 Group">Year 24 Group</a>, of which Takemiya was a member. The mature subject material of <i>Kaze to Ki no Uta</i> and its focus on themes of sadomasochism, incest, and rape were controversial for <span title="Japanese-language romanization"><i lang="ja-Latn">shōjo</i></span> manga of the 1970s; it took nearly seven years from Takemiya's initial conceptualization of the story for her editors at the publishing company <a href="/wiki/Shogakukan" title="Shogakukan">Shogakukan</a> to agree to publish it.
</p>
            <p>Upon its eventual release, <i>Kaze to Ki no Uta</i> achieved significant critical and commercial success, with Takemiya winning the 1979 <a href="/wiki/Shogakukan_Manga_Award" title="Shogakukan Manga Award">Shogakukan Manga Award</a>  in both the <span title="Japanese-language romanization"><i lang="ja-Latn">shōjo</i></span> and <a href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga" title="Shōnen manga"><span title="Japanese-language romanization"><i lang="ja-Latn">shōnen</i></span></a> (manga for boys) categories for <i>Kaze to Ki no Uta</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Toward_the_Terra" title="Toward the Terra">Toward the Terra</a></i>, respectively. It is regarded as a pioneering work of <span title="Japanese-language romanization"><i lang="ja-Latn">shōnen-ai</i></span>, and is credited by critics with widely popularizing the genre. An <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> film adaptation of the series, <span title="Hepburn transliteration"><i lang="ja-Latn">Kaze to Ki no Uta Sanctus: Sei Naru Kana</i></span><span style="font-weight: normal"> (<span title="Japanese-language text"><span lang="ja">風と木の詩 SANCTUS－聖なるかな－</span></span>, <abbr title="literal translation">lit.</abbr> "The Poem of Wind and Trees Sanctus: Is It Holy?")</span>, was released as an <a href="/wiki/Original_video_animation" title="Original video animation">original video animation</a> (<a href="/wiki/Home_video" title="Home video">home video</a>) in 1987.
