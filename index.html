            <p><b>John Hutchyns Tyndall</b> (14 July 1934 â€“ 19 July 2005) was a British <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fascist" title="Fascist">fascist</a> political activist. A leading member of various small <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neo-Nazi" title="Neo-Nazi">neo-Nazi</a> groups during the late 1950s and 1960s, he was chairman of the <a href="/wiki/National_Front_(UK)" title="National Front (UK)">National Front</a> (NF) from 1972 to 1974 and again from 1975 to 1980, and then chairman of the <a href="/wiki/British_National_Party" title="British National Party">British National Party</a> (BNP) from 1982 to 1999. He unsuccessfully stood for election to the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="House of Commons of the United Kingdom">House of Commons</a> and <a href="/wiki/European_Parliament" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> on several occasions.
</p>
            <p>Born in <a href="/wiki/Devon" title="Devon">Devon</a> and educated in <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, Tyndall undertook <a href="/wiki/National_service" title="National service">national service</a> prior to embracing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extreme_right" title="Extreme right">extreme right</a>. In the mid-1950s, he joined the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Empire_Loyalists" title="League of Empire Loyalists">League of Empire Loyalists</a> (LEL) and came under the influence of its leader, <a href="/wiki/A._K._Chesterton" title="A. K. Chesterton">A. K. Chesterton</a>. Finding the LEL too moderate, he and <a href="/wiki/John_Bean_(politician)" title="John Bean (politician)">John Bean</a> founded in 1957 the <a href="/wiki/National_Labour_Party_(UK,_1957)" title="National Labour Party (UK, 1957)">National Labour Party</a> (NLP), an explicitly <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> group. In 1960, the NLP merged with <a href="/wiki/Colin_Jordan" title="Colin Jordan">Colin Jordan</a>'s <a href="/wiki/White_Defence_League" title="White Defence League">White Defence League</a> to found the first <a href="/wiki/British_National_Party_(1960)" title="British National Party (1960)">British National Party</a> (BNP). Within the BNP, Tyndall and Jordan established a paramilitary wing called Spearhead, which angered Bean and other party members. They expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the <a href="/wiki/National_Socialist_Movement_(UK,_1962)" title="National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962)">National Socialist Movement</a> and then the international <a href="/wiki/World_Union_of_National_Socialists" title="World Union of National Socialists">World Union of National Socialists</a>. In 1962, they were convicted and briefly imprisoned for their paramilitary activities. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall formed his <a href="/wiki/Greater_Britain_Movement" title="Greater Britain Movement">Greater Britain Movement</a> (GBM) in 1964. Although never changing his basic beliefs, by the mid-1960s he was replacing his overt references to Nazism with appeals to <a href="/wiki/British_nationalism" title="British nationalism">British nationalism</a>.
</p>
            <p>In 1967, Tyndall joined Chesterton's newly founded <a href="/wiki/National_Front_(UK)" title="National Front (UK)">National Front</a> (NF) and became its leader in 1972, overseeing growing membership and electoral growth. His leadership was threatened by various factions within the party, which eventually led to him losing his position as leader in 1974. He resumed this position in 1975, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Following an argument with long-term comrade <a href="/wiki/Martin_Webster" title="Martin Webster">Martin Webster</a>, Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980 and formed his short-lived New National Front (NNF). In 1982, he merged the NNF into his own newly formed <a href="/wiki/British_National_Party" title="British National Party">British National Party</a> (BNP). Under Tyndall, the BNP established itself as the UK's most prominent extreme-right group during the 1980s, although electoral success eluded it. Tyndall's refusal to moderate the BNP's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of "modernisers" in the party, who ousted him in favour of <a href="/wiki/Nick_Griffin" title="Nick Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> in 1999. In 2005, Tyndall was charged with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Incitement_to_racial_hatred" title="Incitement to racial hatred">incitement to racial hatred</a> for comments made at a BNP meeting. He died two days before his trial was due to take place.
</p>
            <p>Tyndall promoted a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Racial-nationalist" title="Racial-nationalist">racial-nationalist</a> belief in a distinct white "British race", arguing that this race was threatened by a Jewish conspiracy to encourage non-white migration into Britain. He called for the establishment of an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Authoritarian" title="Authoritarian">authoritarian</a> state which would deport all non-whites from the country, engage in a <a href="/wiki/Eugenics" title="Eugenics">eugenics</a> project, and re-establish the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> through the military conquest of parts of Africa. He never gained any mainstream political respectability in the UK, although he proved popular among sectors of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_far-right" title="British far-right">British far-right</a>.
