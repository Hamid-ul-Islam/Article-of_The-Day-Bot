            <p><i><b>Thalassodromeus</b></i> is a <a href="/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pterosaur" title="Pterosaur">pterosaur</a> that lived in what is now Brazil during the <a href="/wiki/Early_Cretaceous" title="Early Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Period_(geology)" title="Period (geology)">period</a>, about a hundred million years ago. The original skull, discovered in 1983 in the <a href="/wiki/Araripe_Basin" title="Araripe Basin">Araripe Basin</a> of northeastern Brazil, was collected in several pieces. In 2002, the skull was made the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Holotype_specimen" title="Holotype specimen">holotype specimen</a> of <i><b>Thalassodromeus sethi</b></i> by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palaeontologist" title="Palaeontologist">palaeontologists</a> <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Kellner" title="Alexander Kellner">Alexander Kellner</a> and Diogenes de Almeida Campos. The generic name means "sea runner" (in reference to its supposed mode of feeding), and the <a href="/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)" title="Specific name (zoology)">specific name</a> refers to the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptian</a> god <a href="/wiki/Set_(deity)" title="Set (deity)">Seth</a> due to its crest being supposedly reminiscent of Seth's crown. Other scholars have pointed out that the crest was instead similar to the crown of <a href="/wiki/Amun" title="Amun">Amon</a>. A jaw tip was assigned to <i>T. sethi</i> in 2005, became the basis of the new genus <i><a href="/wiki/Banguela" title="Banguela">Banguela</a></i> in 2014, and assigned back to <i>Thalassodromeus</i> as the <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> <i><b>T. oberlii</b></i> in 2018. Another species (<i>T. sebesensis</i>) was named in 2015 based on a supposed crest fragment, but this was later shown to be part of a turtle shell.
</p>
            <p><i>Thalassodromeus</i> had one of the largest known skulls among pterosaurs, around 1.42 m (4 ft 8 in) long, with one of the proportionally largest cranial crests of any <a href="/wiki/Vertebrate" title="Vertebrate">vertebrate</a>. Though only the skull is known, the animal is estimated to have had a <a href="/wiki/Wingspan" title="Wingspan">wingspan</a> of 4.2 to 4.5 m (14 to 15 ft). The crest was lightly built and ran from the tip of the upper jaw to beyond the back of the skull, ending in a unique V-shaped notch. The jaws were toothless, and had sharp upper and lower edges. Its skull had large nasoantorbital <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fenestrae" title="Fenestrae">fenestrae</a> (opening that combined the <a href="/wiki/Antorbital_fenestra" title="Antorbital fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> in front of the eye with the bony nostril), and part of its <a href="/wiki/Palate" title="Palate">palate</a> was concave. The lower jaw was blade-like, and may have turned slightly upwards. The closest relative of <i>Thalassodromeus</i> was <i>Tupuxuara</i>; both are grouped in a <a href="/wiki/Clade" title="Clade">clade</a> that has been placed within either <a href="/wiki/Tapejaridae" title="Tapejaridae">Tapejaridae</a> (as the subfamily <a href="/wiki/Thalassodrominae" title="Thalassodrominae">Thalassodrominae</a>) or within <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neoazhdarchia" title="Neoazhdarchia">Neoazhdarchia</a> (as the family Thalassodromidae).
</p>
            <p>Several theories have been suggested to explain the function of <i>Thalassodromeus'</i>s crest, including <a href="/wiki/Thermoregulation" title="Thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Display_(zoology)" title="Display (zoology)">display</a>, but it likely had more than one function. The crests of thalassodromids appear to have developed late in growth (probably correlated with <a href="/wiki/Sexual_maturity" title="Sexual maturity">sexual maturity</a>) and they may have been <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sexually_dimorphic" title="Sexually dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a> (differing according to sex). As the genus name implies, <i>Thalassodromeus</i> was originally proposed to have fed like a modern <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Skimmer_(bird)" title="Skimmer (bird)">skimmer</a> bird, by skimming over the water's surface and dipping its lower jaws to catch prey. This idea was later criticised for lack of evidence; <i>Thalassodromeus</i> has since been found to have had strong jaw musculature, and may have been able to kill and eat relatively large prey on the ground. The limb proportions of related species indicate that it may have adapted to fly in inland settings, and would have been efficient at moving on the ground. <i>Thalassodromeus</i> is known from the <a href="/wiki/Romualdo_Formation" title="Romualdo Formation">Romualdo Formation</a>, where it coexisted with many other types of pterosaurs, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dinosaurs" title="Dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a> and other animals.

            <p>The first known specimen of this <a href="/wiki/Pterosaur" title="Pterosaur">pterosaur</a> (an extinct <a href="/wiki/Order_(biology)" title="Order (biology)">order</a> of flying reptiles) was collected in 1983 near the town of <a href="/wiki/Santana_do_Cariri" title="Santana do Cariri">Santana do Cariri</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Araripe_Basin" title="Araripe Basin">Araripe Basin</a> of northeastern Brazil. Found in outcrops of the <a href="/wiki/Romualdo_Formation" title="Romualdo Formation">Romualdo Formation</a>, it was collected over a long period in several pieces. The specimen (catalogued as DGM 1476-R at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Museu_de_Ci%C3%AAncias_da_Terra" title="Museu de Ciências da Terra">Museu de Ciências da Terra</a>) was preserved in a <a href="/wiki/Calcareous" title="Calcareous">calcareous</a> <a href="/wiki/Nodule_(geology)" title="Nodule (geology)">nodule</a>, and consists of an almost-complete, three-dimensional skull (pterosaur bones are often flattened <a href="/wiki/Compression_fossil" title="Compression fossil">compression fossils</a>), missing two segments of the bottom of the skull and mandible and the front of the lower jaw. The left <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jugal_region" title="Jugal region">jugal region</a> and right mandibular ramus (half of the mandible) are pushed slightly inward. The skull was first reported in a 1984 Italian book, and preliminarily described and figured in 1990 by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Palaeontologist" title="Palaeontologist">palaeontologists</a> <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Kellner" title="Alexander Kellner">Alexander Kellner</a> and Diogenes de Almeida Campos. Although the pieces of skull had been divided between museums in South and North America, they were assembled before 2002.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-kellner&amp;campos2002_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-kellner&amp;campos2002-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Veldmeijer2006_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Veldmeijer2006-2">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWitton2013234–243_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWitton2013234–243-3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
