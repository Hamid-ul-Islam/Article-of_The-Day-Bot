            <p><b>Tyler Wayne Skaggs</b><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> (July 13, 1991 – July 1, 2019) was an American left-handed <a href="/wiki/Professional_baseball" title="Professional baseball">professional baseball</a> <a href="/wiki/Starting_pitcher" title="Starting pitcher">starting pitcher</a>. He played in <a href="/wiki/Major_League_Baseball" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) for the <a href="/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks" title="Arizona Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels" title="Los Angeles Angels">Los Angeles Angels</a> from 2012 until his death in 2019.
</p>
            <p>A native of <a href="/wiki/Woodland_Hills,_Los_Angeles" title="Woodland Hills, Los Angeles">Woodland Hills, California</a>, and a graduate of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Monica_High_School" title="Santa Monica High School">Santa Monica High School</a>, Skaggs was a supplemental first-round selection for the Angels in the <a href="/wiki/2009_Major_League_Baseball_draft" title="2009 Major League Baseball draft">2009 Major League Baseball draft</a>. He was traded to the Diamondbacks the following year as part of an exchange for pitcher <a href="/wiki/Dan_Haren" title="Dan Haren">Dan Haren</a> and rose through Arizona's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Farm_system" title="Farm system">farm system</a>. After two consecutive appearances at the <a href="/wiki/All-Star_Futures_Game" title="All-Star Futures Game">All-Star Futures Game</a> in 2011 and 2012, Skaggs made his major league debut on August<span class="nowrap"> </span>22, 2012, against the <a href="/wiki/Miami_Marlins" title="Miami Marlins">Miami Marlins</a>. He remained with the Diamondbacks through the end of the season, but was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Option_(baseball)" title="Option (baseball)">optioned</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball" title="Minor League Baseball">minor leagues</a> in 2013. In December 2013 the Diamondbacks traded Skaggs back to the Angels, and he served as the fifth member of the team's starting pitching rotation until an <a href="/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_of_elbow_joint" title="Ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint">ulnar collateral ligament</a> (UCL) injury and subsequent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tommy_John_surgery" title="Tommy John surgery">Tommy John surgery</a> derailed his season on July<span class="nowrap"> </span>31, 2014. Despite his initial plans to begin pitching in the minor leagues by the end of the 2015 season, Skaggs did not start practicing again until the beginning of the 2016 season and returned to the Angels mound that July. Although he figured prominently in the Angels' rotation between 2017 and 2019, Skaggs continued missing large parts of each season because of injury. Through June 2019, he posted a career <a href="/wiki/Earned_run_average" title="Earned run average">earned run average</a> (ERA) of 4.41, recorded 476 <a href="/wiki/Strikeout" title="Strikeout">strikeouts</a>, and had a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Win%E2%80%93loss_record" title="Win–loss record">win–loss record</a> of 28–38.
</p>
            <p>On July 1, 2019, Skaggs was found unresponsive in his hotel room in <a href="/wiki/Southlake,_Texas" title="Southlake, Texas">Southlake, Texas</a>, where the Angels had been visiting for a series against the <a href="/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)" title="Texas Rangers (baseball)">Texas Rangers</a>. He was pronounced dead the same day. An autopsy concluded at the end of August that Skaggs had accidentally died of <a href="/wiki/Asphyxia" title="Asphyxia">asphyxia</a> after <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_aspiration" title="Pulmonary aspiration">aspirating</a> his own vomit while under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Fentanyl" title="Fentanyl">fentanyl</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oxycodone" title="Oxycodone">oxycodone</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)" title="Alcohol (drug)">alcohol</a>. That October, former Angels director of communications, Eric Kay, was indicted on charges relating to Skaggs's death when he admitted to providing opiates to various members of the Angels, including Skaggs. Kay was convicted on two counts relating to Skaggs's death in February 2022. The Angels wore a No. 45 patch on their jerseys for the rest of the 2019 season in memory of Skaggs, while his widow and mother set up a <a href="/wiki/Foundation_(nonprofit)" title="Foundation (nonprofit)">charitable foundation</a> in his name.
